        <p>QuickBites is a food delivery website designed as a final year project for BN College, Patna. The primary goal of this project is to provide a seamless online platform where users, especially students, can browse, order, and enjoy meals from the best restaurants in Patna. With an intuitive interface and a clean design, QuickBites aims to bring convenience, variety, and savings to the food-ordering experience.

            The website features a curated list of popular restaurants around Patna, including North Indian, South Indian, Chinese, Continental, and other multi-cuisine options. Each restaurant card displays essential information such as the name, cuisine type, average cost for two, distance from the user, and ratings. Users can also view exclusive offers, such as discounts on pre-booking, bank offers, and cashback deals via popular payment platforms like PhonePe.
            
            One of the key features of QuickBites is its user-friendly interface, which ensures that even first-time users can easily navigate and place orders. The design uses responsive cards to display restaurant details with attractive visuals and icons for table booking, free dessert, and available discounts. The layout is clean, mobile-friendly, and easy to scale.
            
            QuickBites was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and fast. Additional enhancements such as animations, image sliders, and interactive buttons are included to improve user engagement. There is scope for future development such as adding a login system, order tracking, feedback modules, and online payment integration.
            
            From a technical perspective, this project demonstrates strong front-end development skills and knowledge of UI/UX principles. It also shows how real-world food delivery systems work and how students can use web technologies to create practical and marketable products.
            
            In the context of BN College, this website solves a real problem ‚Äî students often don‚Äôt have time to cook or go out for meals, especially during exam seasons or bad weather. QuickBites makes it easier to find good food at good prices, delivered right to their hostel or home.
            
            Overall, QuickBites is not just a project for evaluation but a prototype for a potentially scalable business idea that blends technology and daily convenience.</p>
